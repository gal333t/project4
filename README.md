# Can I BRAD this?

### Link will go here eventually :)

The website is currently not working but will be deployed [here](https://gal333t.github.io/project4/)

### Firstly, what even is BRAD?

BRAD stands for Banish Recycling And Disposal Program, started by Banish a company who sell sustainable items as well as share education on sustainability. Everyday Aussies can send in their hard to recycle items, and the team of volunteers will sort and send them through to different waste streams.

### What is 'Can I BRAD this?'

Aimed at beginners, people new to the BRAD program, it's a fun game where you have to select whether or not an item can be recycled by BRAD. When you login, your score will save on the scoreboard.

### Inspiration behind the project

I've been a volunteer with Banish for just over 2 years now, sorting through hundreds of BRAD parcels. For my last project, I wanted it to be something that speaks to me and show a bit about who I am. I also hope it'll be beneficial for newbies to BRAD, or anyone looking to test their knowledge, and increase awareness for the program.

### Technologies used

The front end was built with React, and the backend with Supabase which is something new I learnt for this project. For CSS I aim to use Chakra UI as they have a strong focus on accessibility as well.

### Aims

I want this project to reflect me, and with that, the causes I care about. 2 of the big ones are sustainability & accessibility, so I would love to have my app be as accessible as possible following guidelines from [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) and [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

### Features

Game itself - an image and item name will show up and you have to select 'yes' or 'no' if you think you can recycle it with BRAD

Scoreboard - for users who choose to login, your score will be saved and rendered on the scoreboard

Login/sessions - set up with Supabase making it super streamlined

### What do I want to do with this project next?

Advanced options for more frequent BRAD users, probably a collaboration with Lottie from Banish to workout how we make this harder
