# Can I BRAD this?

### Firstly, what even is BRAD?

BRAD stands for Banish Recycling And Disposal Program, started by Banish a company who sell sustainable items as well as share education on sustainability. Everyday Aussies can send in their hard to recycle items, and the team of volunteers will sort and send them through to different waste streams.

### What is 'Can I BRAD this?'

Aimed at beginners, people new to the BRAD program, it's a fun game where you have to select whether or not an item can be recycled by BRAD. When you login, your score will save on the scoreboard.

### Inspiration behind the project

I've been a volunteer with Banish for just over 2 years now, sorting through hundreds of BRAD parcels. For my last project, I wanted it to be something that speaks to me and show a bit about who I am. I also hope it'll be beneficial for newbies to BRAD, or anyone looking to test their knowledge, and increase awareness for the program.

### Aims

I want this project to reflect me, and with that, the causes I care about. 2 of the big ones are sustainability & accessibility, so I would love to have my app be accessible and to try learn about a11y and execute it correctly in my code.

### What do I want to do with this project next?

Advanced options for more frequent BRAD users, probably a collaboration with Lottie from Banish to workout how we make this harder
